<h2 class="Title4">Description</h2>
<p> I know what you're thinking. A recipe for <em>instant ramen</em>? Don’t you just follow the directions on the package—boil water, dump in noodles and spice packets, and “stir occasionally”?</p>
<p> The following step-by-step directions for preparing a standard four-ounce package of ramen was developed to create the <strong>best possible version</strong> of instant noodles.</p>
<h2 class="Title4">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 pack of instant noodles</li>
    <li>2½ cups of water</li>
    <li>1 raw egg</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="Title4">Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Bring 2 ½ cups of water to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add the soup base and vegetable mix. Boil for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add the whole disc of dried noodles. <em>Do not break the noodles in half.</em> I know it’s fun to break stuff, but you must resist. Instead, slip the noodles into the boiling broth and press them down with chopsticks or a fork to keep them submerged. Don't stir the noodles—just keep them submerged. After 2 minutes, the noodles will soften and break apart.</li>
    <li>Fan it! This is critical: simply boiling the noodles for 4-5 minutes, as most ramen directions read, produces a limp and soggy noodle. At the two minute mark, when the noodles have softened and come apart, pull the noodles from the broth and fan them for two minutes. The flow of air will stunt the cooking process, which gives the noodles a slightly more <em>al dente</em> texture.</li>
    <li>Return the now-cooled noodles to the broth. Crack a raw egg over the noodles, cover the pot, and boil for 30 seconds. Turn off the heat, cover and let sit for 30 seconds more. Serve immediately.</li>
